				Elliott grew up in a small town in Kansas where he preferred time on a computer and taking apart VCRs over bailing hay and corralling stray cows. He has been developing for an extensive 6 months. He enjoys long walks on the beach - provided he remembers his sunscreen - and a lighthearted RomCom.
